1. Introduction

WhereBox (“the App”) is a home inventory and lost-items organizer designed to help users organize and keep track of their belongings.
The App is built with a privacy-by-design approach.

This Privacy Policy explains what information is handled when you use WhereBox, how it is used, and the choices available to you.

2. Information We Collect
2.1 User Content Stored Locally on Your Device

WhereBox is an offline-first application. All user-created content is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to any server operated by us.

Locally stored data may include:

Inventory items (names, categories, locations, notes)

Rooms, storage areas, bags, and packing lists

Tags and labels you create

App preferences and settings

Under normal app operation, we do not have access to, visibility into, or control over this data.

2.2 Anonymous Analytics Information

WhereBox uses Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous usage analytics. This data helps us understand how the App is used and improve stability and usability.

Firebase Analytics may collect:

Screen views and feature usage events

Basic app performance and diagnostic data

General device and operating system information

Approximate region information provided by Firebase Analytics

Important clarifications:

No advertising analytics are enabled

No IDFA (Identifier for Advertisers) is collected

No cross-app or cross-service tracking is performed

Analytics data is not intentionally linked to a user’s identity

Analytics data is not used to build user profiles

Analytics data is not used for advertising or remarketing

2.3 Information We Do Not Collect

We do not collect:

Names

Email addresses

Phone numbers

Precise location or GPS data

Contacts or address books

Photos or media from the photo library

Advertising identifiers

Any information intended to directly identify you

3. How We Use Information

Information is used solely to:

Enable core app functionality (local data stored on your device)

Understand which features are most useful

Identify and fix bugs or crashes

Improve app performance and user experience

We do not use information to:

Identify you personally

Serve advertisements

Sell or rent data

Build marketing or behavioral profiles

Track you across other apps or websites

4. Data Sharing

We do not sell, rent, or share user data with third parties.

Anonymous analytics data is processed by Firebase Analytics (Google LLC) solely for analytics and diagnostics purposes and cannot be used to identify individual users.

We may disclose information if required by law; however, since we do not collect personal data, there is typically no personal information to disclose.

5. Third-Party Services
Firebase Analytics (Google LLC)

WhereBox uses Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous app usage statistics. Firebase may process:

App usage events

Basic device and operating system information

Approximate region information

Firebase Analytics data handling is governed by Google’s Privacy Policy.
We have configured Firebase Analytics to:

Disable advertising features

Disable remarketing and audiences

Disable cross-app tracking

Not collect advertising identifiers (IDFA)

6. Data Retention

Local Data: Your inventory data remains on your device until you delete it within the App or uninstall the App. We have no ability to delete or retrieve this data remotely.

Analytics Data: Anonymous analytics data is retained according to Firebase’s default retention settings and is not linked to your identity.

7. Export and Backup

WhereBox allows you to export and import backup files using the iOS Files app.

Exported files are saved only where you choose

You have full control over these files

We do not access, upload, or store exported or imported files

Backup files are not automatically uploaded anywhere

8. App Permissions

WhereBox requests only the permissions necessary to function as intended.

The App may request:

File access for importing and exporting backups via the iOS Files app

The App does not request access to:

Location data

Contacts

Microphone

Camera

Photo library

Advertising identifiers

9. Security

User data is stored locally using standard iOS data protection mechanisms. Because data remains on your device, its security also depends on your device’s operating system protections, such as passcodes and biometric authentication.

No method of electronic storage is completely secure; however, we take reasonable measures appropriate to the nature of the App.

10. Your Choices and Rights

You have full control over your data:

You can edit or delete stored items at any time

You can export or remove backup files you create

You can remove all local data by uninstalling the App

Because we do not maintain user accounts or servers, we do not store personal data centrally.

11. Children’s Privacy

WhereBox is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

12. International Users

WhereBox may be used internationally. Anonymous analytics data may be processed by Firebase servers located in different countries in accordance with applicable data protection laws. This data is not linked to your identity.

13. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the “Effective Date” at the top of this policy. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
